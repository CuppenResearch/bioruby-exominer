Exominer helps build a list of genes that may be used for building a
targeted exome design for sequencing. The inputs are a list of Pubmed
IDs with text files (PDF, HTML, Word, Excel have to be exported to
plain text first). Exominer harvests gene names from these documents
using a default symbol list with aliases. 

All matches are written with their sources, symbol frequencies,
year, and user provided keywords and impact scores and written out.

Exominer also exports to RDF, so that the gene symbols can be stored
into a triple-store and link out to Bio2rdf resources.  The latter
allows harvesting pathways.

Every RDF export contains full information on the origin of symbols.
Over time designs can be compared against each other and a historical
record is maintained. It is a good idea to store the textual versions
of the files too.

The initial symbol list with aliases can be fetched/generated from external
sources, such as NCBI, Biomart and/or Bio2rdf. Some example scripts
are in ./scripts

Note: this software is under active development!
